# Saoirse

This is the Git repository for the sandbox game *Saoirse*.


It's written in Python and uses [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) and [Tk](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) for rendering, window creation, and media. It's meant to be run with [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/index.html) and packaged with [PyInstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/).


It's still in very early development but is already being kept in version control.
