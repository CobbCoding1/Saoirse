# Saoirse

This is the Git repository for the sandbox game *Saoirse*.


It's written in Python and uses [Pyglet](https://pypi.org/project/pyglet/) for rendering, window creation, and media. It's meant to be run with [pypy](https://www.pypy.org/index.html) and packaged with [pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/).


It's still in very early development but is already being kept in version control.
