# Saoirse

This is the Git repository for the sandbox game *Saoirse*.


It's written in Python and uses either [Pyglet](http://pyglet.org/), [Pyray](https://github.com/electronstudio/raylib-python-cffi) or a combination of [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) and [Tk](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) for rendering, window creation, and media. The preferred and default option is Pyglet, the Pillow and Tk system is much slower and meant primarily older graphics cards that lack support OpenGL 3.3+, although players can feel free to use this system for other reasons as they see fit.
It's meant to be compiled and packaged with [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/).


It's still in very early development but is already being kept in version control.
